# Using Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
#

# We pass authtoken and setId in the query string and put results in the POST body
# (Putting the authtoken in the query string is not recommended! See below for a better method)
# We let curl do encoding by using --data-urlencode
curl "${baseurl}storeResults?authtoken=${authtoken}&setId=${setid}" \
  --data-urlencode results@../results-new.json

# Alternatively, we can also put authtoken and setId in the POST body
# We _could_ use -d (or --data) for authtoken and setId because they are alphanumeric only and don't need URL-encoding
# for results, we really need to make sure data is properly encoded
curl "${baseurl}storeResults" \
  -d access_token="$authtoken" --data setId="$setid" \
  --data-urlencode results@../results-new.json

# If you're sure results content is already properly encoded, you can also use -d
# We also use the appropriate header for the token
curl "${baseurl}storeResults" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${authtoken}" \
  -d setId="$setid" \
  -d results='%5B%7B%22date%22%3A+%222020-02-20%22%7D%5D'

#
# Using Content-Type multipart/form-data
#

# Instead of using -d (or --data), we use -F (or --form)
# This is a bit awkward in curl CLI, but in principal this works just as well as URL-encoding
# Note that we're NOT using results=@results-new.json, which would upload the file
# Also note that the Bearer authorization spec (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.2)
# says that clients "MUST NOT" put the token in the post body when using this content type!
# AlisQI does support it, but the recommended method is to use the Authorization header.
